# AI Scheduler Proposal

## Problem Statement
For my project for CPTR 430 I would like to build an AI based scheduling app. I would like this application to allow for adding a list of tasks and dates when they should be completed. Right now this list would likely contain assignments and their due dates. I would like to build this application in a way that I can continue using it for scheduling suggestions after I graduate from college. When the application receives the list of tasks, there should be an option to allow AI to schedule the tasks for you in an optimal way. You should be able to block out time when nothing can be scheduled. 


## Stretch Goals
- Apple Notes Integration
- Apple Calendar Integration


## Initial System Idea
### Idea 1
- My plan is to use Swift and develop for an Apple environment
- This would entail developing in XCode
- I would use GitHub for version control

### Idea 2
- If I decide to use a language other than Swift, I would probably build a web application using React.
- I would develop in Visual Studio Code
- I would use GitHub for version control

### For Both Ideas
- I plan to try to work with the CS lab ollama server as well as running ollama models locally for development
